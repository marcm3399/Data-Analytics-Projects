# Data-Analytics-Projects
This is my work produced for my Advanced Data Analytics class taken in the fall of 2022. This was my first semester using Python in Jupyter Notebook. Most of the data is sourced from Kaggle or my Professor (Dr. Ahmad Namini), and I created the code with help from Kaggle and my Professors instructive notebooks.
